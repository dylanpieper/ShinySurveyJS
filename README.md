The goal of this package is to integrate the frontend flexibility of the [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/) library with the backend capabilities of [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) to interface with a database and create dynamic user experiences. The sky is the limit. Host a single survey or multiple surveys in one app.
